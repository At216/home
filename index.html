<strong><h2>At216 home</h2></strong><br>

Welcome to at216.github.io/main! Check out some of my websites below. This is the homepage
for ServersNJS. <br><br>

<!--Check out <a href="https://at216.github.io/">https://serversnjs.w3spaces.com/</a> for an awesome webserver builder! 
This site writes a NodeJS server for you to download. 
Simply input your filepath/filename parameters and 
the website will generate a NodeJS server for you to download and 
run on your computer<br><br>-->

Check out <a href="https://at216.github.io/tab-organizer/">https://at216.github.io/tab-organizer/</a> 
for a helpful website tool to help organize your browser tabs! My favorite feature is the tab color buttons that
let you change the favicon to different colors. <br><br>

Check out <a href="https://at216.github.io/BrowserNotes/">https://at216.github.io/BrowserNotes/</a> 
for a helpful website tool to make and save notes in your broswer! I personally find this helpful when I have several tabs
open to reference later; I can simply write myself a quick memo about what I need to do with the tabs in case I forget.  <br><br>

Check out <a href="https://at216.github.io/web-computer/">https://at216.github.io/web-computer/</a> 
for a fun web-based computer simulator. I am planning to add more features and some surprises, so keep an eye out here! <br><br>

Check out <a href="https://at216.github.io/HTML-editor">https://at216.github.io/HTML-editor/</a> 
for a simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code editor. This editor operates independently of any servers to render code, so pull 
it up and code online or offline. I am planning style updates to this site, so stay tuned! <br><br>

Check out <a href="https://at216.github.io/DD-DMS-DD/">https://at216.github.io/DD-DMS-DD/</a> 
for a Decimal-Degrees and Degrees-Minutes-Seconds converter calculator. This is helpful in the civil engineering/surveying field, 
when angles might be given in one measure and you need them in a different one.  <br><br>

Check out <a href="https://at216.github.io/blog/">https://at216.github.io/blog/</a> 
for my first public blog! I am featuring some of my favorite public websites as well as some commentary and insight 
about what went in to making them.  <br><br>
